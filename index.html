      <h1> About the Artist </h1>
      <p> Darcy is a New Zealand based design and Illustration student currently enrolled at Massey University of Wellington.
          Darcy works predominantly in traditional drawing and illustration, often working in Moleskin sketchbooks. His work
          often explores interactions between nature and human elements, using a mix of abstraction and realism to create
          whimsy within his drawings. </p>
